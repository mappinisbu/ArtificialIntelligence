* Search : All source code resides here.
* Search/dfs1.p : the prolog code for DFS
* Search/bfs.p : the prolog code for BFS
* Search/astar: the prolog code for astar
* The corners problem uses the BFS prolog code.

search.py : Consists of integration of prolog and python using spade and calls respective search strategies for solving mazes
searchAgents.py : Populates the prolog facts
